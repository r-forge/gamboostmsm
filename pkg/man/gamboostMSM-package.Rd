\title{Component-wise Functional Gradient Descent Boosting of Multi State Models}
\description{Gradient boosting for Cox-type multi state models: minimization of negative partial log likelihood using component- and transition-wise base-learners.}
\details{This package provides function objects to fit Cox-type multi state models using the functional gradient descent boosting algorithm as implemented in the splendid package \code{mboost}. Therefore, function \code{Family()} for fitting multi state models is given, including negative log partial likelihood of a Cox-type multi state model as risk function and its negative first partial derivative with respect to the linear predictor as working response function.}
